When you look online for tools to monitor your website traffic, you have probably seen and heard of Google analytics. It is the most widely used website monitoring tool but not the best. I can with great conscience tell you that it's bloated, hard to use, and does not take good care of your users' data.

In this blog post, I will list three privacy-focused alternatives to Google Analytics.

## 1. Panelbear

A single dashboard that gives you a bird's eye view of your website traffic stats. You can easily view unique visitor count, popular pages, top countries, traffic sources, device types, and performance metrics - all in one tool.

Panelbear was designed for visitor privacy in mind from day one. Enjoy useful insights while protecting the privacy of your visitors.

I use Panelbear for this website and any other website I run personally, I used to always run my websites with [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/HCD5N4) but have for the last year been using Panelbear.

It is hard to put into words how useful Panelbear can be, and all that in a hobby project from one guy in Germany.

Panelbear runs on a simple pricing scheme and has a whole bunch of useful features.

## 2. Fathom Analytics

Fathom is a simple, lightweight, privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics. So, stop scrolling through pages of reports and collecting gobs of personal data about your visitors, both of which you probably don’t need. Their website stats show up on a single, blazingly fast dashboard so you can make business decisions quickly.

I used to run all my websites on Fathom Analytics. I can tell you, it is very user-friendly, has a great pricing structure, and is also run by an amazing team. The only reason I switched from Fathom is mainly that I love testing out indie projects and [Panelbear](https://panelbear.com/?ref=sigurdarson.is) was one that caught my eye.

If you are looking for a cheap user-friendly alternative to Google Analytics, then Fathom is the one for you.

## 3. Plausible

Plausible is a lightweight and open-source website analytics tool. No cookies and fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR. Made and hosted in the EU.

Like Fathom Plausible has a great team that focuses on users' privacy then playing up to big tech.

A huge plus is that Plausible is (< 1 KB) and open-source, their script is 45 times smaller than Google Analytics. Your page weight will be cut down, your site will load faster and you'll reduce your carbon footprint for a greener and more sustainable web.

Plausible is a great tool when working in a team. Your stats are private by default but you can choose to be transparent and make them public so anyone with your custom link can view them. You can embed the dashboard into your website too. You can invite team members and assign user roles too.

## A few last words.

You won't go wrong with any of the ones listed above. They are all lightweight, privacy alternatives to Google Analytics.

Google has been connected to various privacy concerns among users, Google Analytics is a habit website owners, bloggers, and web developers should try to stop. So here has been my alternatives that you should try to use to remove Google Analytics from your website and help create a more open, independent web that’s more friendly to your visitors.
